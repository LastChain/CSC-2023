### For Whom:

The [conference](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/cybersecurity_standardisation_2023) aims to foster dialogue among policy makers, industry, research and standardisation organisations, in view of an effective implementation of the EU cybersecurity legislation[^1][^2]. The event attracted 3000 registered experts in 2022.

The European Standardisation Organisations [CEN](https://www.cencenelec.eu/european-standardization/), [CENELEC](https://www.cencenelec.eu/) and [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/), are pleased to join forces with [ENISA](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/), the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, to organise the 7th [Cybersecurity Standardisation Conference](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/cybersecurity_standardisation_2023) **‘European Standardisation in support of the EU Legislation’￼￼￼Cybersecurity Standardisation Conference 2023**

The 2023 programme of this well-recognized conference will have dedicated sessions on standardisation activities in the areas related to the emerging EU legislation:

### Andrea Rock - ANSSI

![[Pasted image 20230207140930.png]]
- "wallet" certification 

![[Pasted image 20230207141031.png]]
- CS certification

![[Pasted image 20230207141149.png]]
- Demand for certification on the application itself
- How to evaluate certifications (FiTCEM)
- How does everything fit together (harmonize) (life cycle)?
- Challanges:  
	- Standards-based  
	- Timing, working in tandem to accompany everything.  
	- Harmonizations and proofreading; each member state must be taken into account.  
	- Coorporation between all parties involved and transparency
- Requierments:  
    - Trust service provider and certificates  
    - proper standards


### Chiara Giovannini - ANEC

- Working Group related standards and issues for consumers  
    - Should I trust the digital wallet?  
    - How can I trust the digital wallet?  
    - How can I trust the interactions to be secured between different entities  
- What are the costs involved, particularly the initial costs?  
- Digital data is also beneficial.  
	- Is it reliable?  
	- International interoperability and standards are required.  
- The wallet's interaction with the cyber security system will be critical.  
- Wallet, application, and security certification? -> Priority: What to certify?  
- to stay voluntary  
- data-quality contained   
- capacity, responsibility, and equality (Laws against forced use of the digital wallet are a precondition.)


### Wojciech Wiewiorowski - EDPS

- Data protection authorities on national level  
- Entities linked to transmission in individual member states  

How to Put It All Together
- A framework alone is insufficient.  
	- regulations  
	- What does the Toolbox accomplish; more specific  
- Are all critical components in place and secure?  
	- What about cultural and elemental rights?  
	- The authorities in charge of data protection must be involved.  
	- failing to discontinue tracking and profiling (how to avoid this; how to improve acceptance and usage).  
	- Who has the right to alter fundamental rights if the deciding factor is deminishing  
	- Prior to general data protection certifications... and the threat of regulation... an overview of each of those certifications must be present.  
	- Discuss individual entities' concerns and worries.  
	- who controls the data; owning is a wrong term and should not be used in this context.


## Panel 4: Landscape of the EU cybersecurity legislation

![[Pasted image 20230207165859.png]]

### Ben Kokx - Philips

![[Pasted image 20230207153802.png]]
- Regulations concerning products that enter the European markets.
![[Pasted image 20230207153829.png]]
- The development of three harmonized standards with around 167 members.
![[Pasted image 20230207154407.png]]
- RED is only for the product and what's inside.
![[Pasted image 20230207154507.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207154555.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207154738.png]]
- Horizontal scopes for RED and CRA standards may serve to restrict use cases.
- Realization of requirements may reduce usabilities compared to established requirements.
- Demand of product scoping and intended use of products their environment.
- Will the standard be cited? (BIG QUESTION)

### George Sharkov - ESI CEE 

![[Pasted image 20230207155638.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207155802.png]]
- Highlighted fields are related to other fields like security.
![[Pasted image 20230207160026.png]]

### Mariela Pavlova - Infineon
![[Pasted image 20230207161223.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207161229.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207161348.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207161701.png]]
- In Europe, ISO 15408 evaluation smart cards and high-end security.  
- SESIP for IoT: Targeting MCUs in the IT Area.
- FITCEM: European Standard, close to CC, but targeting security evaluations fixed in time.  
- SESIP and FITCEM can be applied to smart cards and the like sooner or later.
![[Pasted image 20230207161835.png]]
- SOGIS used since 20years
	- High end security and indipendent evaluation for certification and continous monitoring  
- EUCC is the successor of SOGIS.  
- EMVCo proprietary and private    
- PSA Certified and GP SESIP is private -> evaluate certification for MCU in IoT Area -> low-level security, basic and substantial level

### Andrea Caccia - Studio Caccia
![[Pasted image 20230207162528.png]]
- Data act standardization breaks down data silos, engages new spaces, and enables interoperability.
![[Pasted image 20230207162710.png]] 
- Many vendor lock-ins limit the use of data that other stakeholders can use.
![[Pasted image 20230207162914.png]]
- Data standardization is required for interoperability in data-processing services.
![[Pasted image 20230207163037.png]]
- Interoperability to establish harmonized standards for data access (e.g., by using APIs) enables smart contracts (related to blockchain) and lowers the barriers to accessing the data, making it available, and meeting standard compliance requirements.
![[Pasted image 20230207163331.png]]
- Cloud provider with interoperability capabilities.
![[Pasted image 20230207163406.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207163430.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207163444.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207163502.png]]
The Data Act is one component, and an important challenge for Europe for enabling a significant data market. A standardized platform for data sharing in smart contracts, but guidance is required to contextualize data and enable interoperability across different organizations, official organs, and standard bodies.

### Eric Vetillard - ENISA

![[Pasted image 20230207164003.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230207164117.png]]
- Requirements for assessment bodies.
- Basic means lower than mainstream certification and slight modification to modify them just enough.
